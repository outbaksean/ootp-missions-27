# mission-extractor

A .NET 10 web app that extracts OOTP 27 mission data from screenshots of the running game client using region-based OCR, then serializes the results to `missions.json` for use by the ootp-missions-27 web app.

Run with `dotnet run` — a browser window opens automatically at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Getting missions from the game

The tool reads pixel regions directly from the OOTP client window. Before capturing:

1. Open OOTP 27 and navigate to the **Missions** screen.
2. Click on the first mission to expand its detail card grid below the mission list.
3. Ensure the OOTP window is on the primary display at the expected resolution (matching the pixel boundaries in `appsettings.json`).
4. Run the extractor (`dotnet run`) — a browser tab opens automatically.
5. For each mission:
   - In OOTP, click the mission row so its detail cards are visible.
   - In the browser UI, click **Capture**. The tool screenshots the OOTP window and OCRs the selected row and its card grid.
   - If the mission has more cards below the initially visible area, scroll OOTP down and click **Capture Details (Bottom)** to append the lower card rows.
   - For `missions`-type missions (where the detail area lists sub-mission names rather than cards), use **Capture Mission Type Details** instead of the normal Capture.
6. Review OCR results in the browser. Correct any misread fields inline and click save.
7. Once all missions are captured, click **Validate** then **Transform** to produce the final `missions.json`.

> **Pixel calibration:** If captures are blank or misaligned, enable `DebugImages` in `appsettings.json` and inspect the saved crop images. Adjust `MissionRowBoundaries` values in the active profile until the crops align with the correct screen regions.

## How it works

1. The app takes a screenshot of the OOTP client window.
2. Pixel boundaries configured in `appsettings.json` define the screen regions for each data cell (category, title, reward, status, and mission detail cards).
3. Each region is cropped and passed through OCR (`OcrCaptureService`) to extract text.
4. The extracted text is assembled into `Mission` DTOs held in memory.
5. The browser UI lets you review and edit all OCR-extracted fields inline before running the next pipeline step.
6. Validate and Transform steps clean the data, map card names to IDs, and write `missions-transformed-{timestamp}.json` to the output directory.

OCR runs cell-by-cell rather than on the full screen to improve accuracy. The tool stops scanning rows automatically when it encounters several consecutive empty captures.

## Browser UI

The UI is a single page served from `wwwroot/index.html`. It shows all missions currently in memory and lets you:

- Edit any field (name, category, reward, status, missionDetails) and save changes without touching JSON files.
- Run pipeline actions (Capture, Validate, Transform, Save/Load Unstructured) via buttons; captured console output appears in the log area.
- View debug images inline next to each field when `DebugImages` is enabled in config.

## Pipeline actions

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Capture | Screenshots the OOTP window and OCRs the top mission row plus its detail card grid |
| Capture Mission Type Details | Like Capture, but reads sub-mission names (row-based regions) instead of card grid cells — use for `missions`-type missions |
| Capture Details (Bottom) | Appends the lower detail card rows to the last captured mission (for missions with cards below the fold) |
| Validate | Runs lightweight cleanup (dedup, field cleaning, status parsing) and reports validation errors |
| Transform | Runs full transformation (card lookup, mission cross-references, topological sort) and writes `missions-transformed-{timestamp}.json` |
| Save Working | Writes current in-memory missions to `missions-working.json` for quick resume |
| Load Working | Loads `missions-working.json` back into memory |
| Save Verified | Writes all verified missions to a timestamped `missions_verified_{timestamp}.json` in the output directory |
| Load Verified | Merges a previously saved verified file into memory, marking those missions as verified |
| Load Verified (Clean) | Same as Load Verified but clears existing missions first |
| Delete Debug Images | Deletes all files in the `debugImages/` directory |

## Configuration

`appsettings.json` controls all pixel boundaries and behavior. A profile named `SelectedOOTPProfile` is selected at startup; add additional profiles for different screen resolutions or window sizes.

### Key settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `DebugImages` | When true, saves cropped region images to `debugImages/` and serves them at `/debug-images/{filename}` |
| `SelectedOOTPProfile` | Name of the active profile |
| `MissionRowBoundaries` | Pixel coordinates for mission list rows and detail card grid |
| `OutputSettings:OutputDirectory` | Directory for saved JSON and report files |

### MissionRowBoundaries fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `TopRow` | Y pixel of the first mission row |
| `RowHeight` | Pixel height of each row |
| `NumRows` | Maximum number of rows to scan |
| `CategoryLeft/Right` | X bounds of the category column |
| `TitleLeft/Right` | X bounds of the mission title column |
| `RewardLeft/Right` | X bounds of the reward column |
| `StatusLeft/Right` | X bounds of the status column |
| `DetailTop1/Bottom1` etc. | Y bounds of each mission detail card row (3 rows) |
| `DetailLeft` | X start of the first detail card column |
| `DetailWidth` | Width of each detail card cell |
| `DetailColumns` | Number of detail card columns per row |

## DTOs

The intended output shape mirrors the `missions.json` schema consumed by the web app.

**Mission**

|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | int | Mission identifier |
| `name` | string | Mission display name |
| `type` | MissionType | `Count`, `Points`, or `Mission` |
| `requiredCount` | int | Number required to complete |
| `reward` | string | Reward description text |
| `category` | string | Mission category label |
| `cards` | MissionCard[] | Cards that count toward the mission |
| `totalPoints` | int | Point target for points-type missions |
| `rewards` | MissionReward[] | Structured reward list |
| `status` | string | Raw OCR status text (pre-transform only) |
| `missionDetails` | string[] | Raw OCR detail card text (pre-transform only) |
| `debugImages` | object | OCR crop paths keyed by field name (pre-transform only) |

**MissionCard**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cardId` | int | Card identifier |
