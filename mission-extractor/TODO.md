# TODO

- [DONE] Only highlight mission details with validation errors
- [DONE] Allow the user to delete missions or mission details manuallly
- [DONE] Show readonly json in report
- requiredCount not parsing correctly
- Find way to set/override parsed values (type, totalCount etc)
- [DONE] Group validation errors by mission
- Mark mission verified

- Transform card title Historical AS to Historical All-Star (check other abbreviations)
- Look Into Early Eras - Corner IF (Negro Leagues), Validation error total points mismatch (total points mismatch seems wrong on all, maybe just due to missing card maps)
- Remove trailing (VAR) from mission title. Also validation error doesn't match the actual mission detail
- Remove all commas from mission titles, not just the first

- Finish Lower Mission Details OCR
- Implement Mission Type Missions OCR
