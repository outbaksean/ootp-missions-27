## Release Work
All bugs and features related to updating missions or base card data will be addressed separately as I plan for the game release.

## Feature Buckets

### Historical Price Data - Won't Do
All features related to analyzing historical price data are out of scope. They would be best done by uploading user data to a server which I do not want to do.

## Features to Revisit
- 2 This might be nice but needs thought
- 7 I want to do this
- 9 I like this idea

### Nice to have Features
- 3 Report is already in a branch, not good as is
- 6 Same as 3
- 12 idk if there's much value, maybe
- 14 probably not worth it, maybe
- 15 worth checking out as low priority
- 16 probably 
- 17 very low priority
- 18 cool but this won't have much use on mobile with the difficulty in uploading
- 20 idk

### Won't Do

## Quality/Documentation/Accessibility
Nice to have, I'll do these after bug/feature and release work are done.

## Performance
I think it's fine, I'll update if I notice problems or get reports. Image optimization is the exception, I should do that. Performance monitoring/analytics are overkill for this app.

## Testing
I want to add unit tests for the algorithm and more playwright tests for the ui. They are low priority.
